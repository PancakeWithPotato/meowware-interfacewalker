**Interface dumper** written for different source (and even source2!) engine powered games. 
**Usage**: 
	1. Running from command line:
		- The first argument should be the name of the process, including the .exe part
		- Wait for it to finish, then press ENTER to "exit" it.
	2. Running standalone
		- When you run it, it will ask you for the process name. Input the entire processname, including the .exe part.
		- Wait for it to finish, then press ENTER to exit it.

The dumped interfaces will be written to a file **logs/processname_log.txt** and also displayed in the console window. 

Tested to work on:
- CS:S
- Team Fortress 2
- CS2
